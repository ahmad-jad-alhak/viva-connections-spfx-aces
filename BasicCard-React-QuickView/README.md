# **Adaptive Card Extension with React Quick View Demo**

## **Summary**

This project demonstrates how to leverage the new features introduced in **SPFx 1.20**, which allow developers to utilize **React** components within the **Quick View** of an Adaptive Card Extension (ACE). The main purpose of this web part is to showcase how to create dynamic, interactive, and reusable components in Quick View using React, enhancing the capabilities of SPFx Adaptive Card Extensions.

   gulp build
   ```

4. **Run the Project in Workbench:**:
  To run the web part locally in the SharePoint Workbench, use:
   ```bash
   gulp serve
   ```

5. **Bundle and Deploy:**:
  If you’re ready to deploy the solution to a SharePoint site, follow these steps:
   ```bash
   gulp bundle --ship
   gulp package-solution --ship
   ```
Then upload the generated `.sppkg` file to your SharePoint App Catalog and install the solution on your site.

## How It Works

This project focuses on creating an **Adaptive Card Extension (ACE)** where the **Quick View** is built using **React components**, which is a new capability introduced in **SPFx 1.20**.

## Key Components

- **QuickViewComponent.tsx**: The main React component that handles the rendering of data within the Quick View. This component:
- Uses **PnPjs** to fetch SharePoint list data.
- Renders a simple UI that dynamically displays list items.
- Handles loading states and error handling for the data fetching process.

- **AdaptiveCardExtension.ts**: The main SPFx extension file, where the **React Quick View** is initialized and passed relevant props like the SharePoint context and list name.

## Usage

- **Viewing the Quick View**: Once deployed, you can add the Adaptive Card Extension to your SharePoint page. The Quick View will display a list of items retrieved from a SharePoint list, showcasing the use of React for dynamic content rendering.

- **Modify List Name**: The list name used in the Quick View can be customized to fetch data from any SharePoint list of your choosing. Simply update the `listName` prop passed to the `QuickViewComponent`.


## Technologies Used

- **SPFx 1.20**: Latest version of SharePoint Framework, which introduces support for React in Quick View.
- **React**: JavaScript library used to build dynamic, interactive user interfaces.
- **PnPjs**: Simplified API wrapper for interacting with SharePoint data.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed programming language used throughout the project.
